# github-actions-playground

Let's play with GitHub Actions!

We use this repository to test and configure GitHub Workflows prior their real usage in repositories of the [Process Analytics organization](https://github.com/process-analytics).

non exhaustive list
- [Generate Documentation API](.github/workflows/generate-documentation-api.yml): simulate API generation and push to github-pages
- [Manage Surge Deployments](.github/workflows/manage-surge-deployments.yml): list all surge deployments or let remove a surge domain
